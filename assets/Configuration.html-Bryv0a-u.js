However, Nutanix uses Controller VMs (CVMs) combined with the local storage within each node to provide shared storage for the cluster that is both redundant and resilient. The combination of computing and distributed local storage resources is now commonly referred to as Hyper-converged Infrastructure (HCI).</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="alt text"></p><p>As a pioneer in the HCI space, Nutanix DSF is a mature solution capable of delivering the performance and resiliency needed to support many different workloads, including enterprise databases, virtual desktops, Remote Office - Branch Office (ROBO), Big Data, and more.</p><p>The two main storage constructs within the DSF are the Storage Pool and Storage Containers.</p><p>The Storage Pool is the aggregation of all of the physical disks within a given Nutanix cluster. The cluster manages data distribution, so other storage pools (like LUNs in a traditional storage environment) are not required. As new nodes are added to a cluster, disks are automatically added to the pool, and the cluster will begin re-distributing data to the new disks as a background task.</p><p>The Storage Containers are software-defined, logical constructs that allow you to configure storage policy for groups of VMs or vDisks. In the next exercise, you will walk through the process for creating and configuring Nutanix storage within Prism.</p><div class="hint-container note"><p class="hint-container-title">To learn more about additional DSF constructs such as vDisks, extents, and extent groups, refer to the Nutanix Bible.</p></div><h3 id="prism-central-storage-configuration-items" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#prism-central-storage-configuration-items"><span>Prism Central Storage Configuration Items</span></a></h3><h4 id="configure-storage-containers" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#configure-storage-containers"><span>Configure Storage Containers</span></a></h4><p>Lets use PC to perform a basic container setup.</p><ol><li><p>From the sidebar menu, select Compute &amp; Storage and then Storage Containers (OR Type “Storage Containers” in the search box and select “Storage Containers -&gt; List”)</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="Drop Down Menu"></p></li><li><p>Click the “Create Storage Container Button”</p></li><li><p>Fill in the following fields:</p><ul><li>Name: <em>Initials</em>-Container</li><li>Click on Advanced Settings <ul><li>Reserved Capacity: 0</li><li>Advertised Capacity: 500</li></ul></li></ul><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="Example SG Configuration"></p></li><li><p>Click the blue &quot;Create&quot; button.</p><p>In a moment you should see your container appear in the container list.

RF sets the number of data copies to maintain (2 or 3). A replication factor of 3 adds an extra layer of data protection at the cost of storage an additional data copy.</p><p>Block Awareness ensures that secondary copies of data are not written to a node within the same physical enclosure as the primary copy. Block Awareness allows for the loss of a multi-node block without experiencing data unavailability. The same concept can be applied using a Nutanix cluster spanning multiple racks.</p><p>The basic requirement for rack/block fault tolerance is to have a minimum of 3 blocks in the cluster (for RF2) as we need to store three copies of metadata.
